# Cask: the macOS menu-bar app. For the CLI and MCP server, see ../Formula/.
#
# Not submitted to homebrew-cask, and not pending there either. homebrew-cask
# requires apps to be signed and notarized by an identified developer; this one
# is ad-hoc signed, which is exactly why the README has an "Open Anyway" step.
# A personal tap has no such gate. If a Developer ID release ever ships, the
# upstream cask becomes worth filing and this file is what gets submitted.
#
# The token is the same as the formula's on purpose, because that is the name
# people will type. Homebrew resolves a bare `brew install email-local-mcp` to
# the FORMULA; the cask needs `--cask` explicitly. Both spellings are in the
# README so nobody has to discover that.
#
# Source of truth is packaging/homebrew/ in the main repo; scripts/brew-sync.sh
# stamps version + sha256 from the release asset and copies it into the tap.

  # Sparkle owns updates: the app checks on launch, every 6 hours, and when the
  # menu opens, then installs silently. Without this, brew treats a
  # self-updated app as "outdated relative to the cask" and reinstalls the
  # pinned version over it on the next `brew upgrade`, silently downgrading a
  # user who did nothing wrong.

  # The Keychain entries are deliberately NOT listed. Homebrew's zap deletes
  # paths; the App Passwords and OAuth refresh tokens live in the login
  # Keychain under the services "email-local-mcp" and "email-local-mcp-oauth",
  # and a cask cannot remove those. caveats says so rather than leaving a user
  # believing zap took everything.
  # name-check: legacy-ok — the retired bundle id, kept so zap still finds it.

  # Both bundle identifiers are listed on purpose. 0.3.0 moved the app from
  # `com.lokilabs.*` to `pl.marcinwalendowski.*`, and macOS keys these
  # directories on whichever identifier wrote them — so anyone who ran an
  # earlier release has state under BOTH. Zapping only the current one leaves
  # the old Preferences plist behind, which is how a "clean uninstall" quietly
  # isn't. The old paths stay listed for as long as an 0.2.x install could
  # plausibly still exist.

      The app is ad-hoc signed and not yet notarized, so macOS blocks the first
      launch. Open System Settings > Privacy & Security, find the "Email Local
      MCP was blocked" notice and click Open Anyway. macOS remembers it.

      Credentials live in your login Keychain under the services
      "email-local-mcp" and "email-local-mcp-oauth". `brew uninstall --zap`
      cannot remove Keychain items; delete those in Keychain Access if you want
      every trace gone.
